To create a venv with visual studio code in an already existent project.
1. Ensure you have a python interpreter installed and selected in visual studio.
2. Open new Python Terminal: Ctrl+Shift+P: Python:Create Terminal
3. In the terminal: python3 -m venv venv
4. This should create a vscode popup with verbiage approximating 'We noticed a new venv. Do you want to use it?' Select Yes.
5. Fin.
